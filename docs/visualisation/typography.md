# ✍️ Typography Best Practices / Gold Standard Guide

This guide outlines the best practices for typography to ensure clarity, accessibility, and consistency in all data visualisations and dashboards.

## 🎯 1. Typography Principles

- **Clarity and Legibility:** Text must be easy to read at all sizes.
- **Hierarchy:** Use font sizes, weights, and styles to establish clear information hierarchy.
- **Consistency:** Use a consistent typeface family and styling throughout.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient contrast and readable font sizes for users with visual impairments.
- **Minimalism:** Avoid using too many typefaces or styles in a single visualization.

## 🆎 2. Recommended Typeface

- **Primary Typeface:** Arial
- **Usage:** Use for all headings, body text, labels, and legends.

## 🔠 3. Font Sizes and Usage

| Element               | Recommended Size | Weight     | Notes                              |
|-----------------------|------------------|------------|----------------------------------|
| Main Heading (H1)     | 24–32 px         | Bold       | Used for page or section titles  |
| Section Headings (H2) | 18–24 px         | Semi-bold  | Used for subsections             |
| Body Text             | 12–14 px         | Regular    | Main content text                |
| Labels                | 10–12 px         | Regular    | Data labels, axis labels         |
| Annotations           | 10–12 px         | Italic/Regular | Supplementary info or notes  |

## 📏 4. Line Height & Spacing

- Use a line height of **1.4–1.6x** the font size for body text.
- Add space between headings and paragraphs for improved scanability.
- Avoid overcrowding text elements.

## 🎨 5. Colour and Contrast

- Ensure **sufficient contrast** between text and background (follow [WCAG AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#contrast-minimum) standards).
- Use **NHS colour palette** where applicable.
- Don’t rely on colour alone—use **text and symbols** for clarity.

## 📐 6. Text Alignment and Capitalisation

- **Alignment:** Use left-aligned text for readability. Avoid justified text.
- **Capitalisation:** Use **sentence case** for most text. Use **title case** only where necessary.

## 🚫 7. Avoid

- Too many **font families** or weights in one dashboard.
- **ALL CAPS** overuse – it reduces readability.
- Fonts smaller than **10 px**.
- Decorative or script fonts.

## ♿ 8. Accessibility Notes

- Ensure text is **legible across screen sizes** and resolutions.
- Use accessible typefaces that support screen readers.
- Test your design for **contrast and zoom readability**.

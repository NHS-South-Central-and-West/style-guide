# 📊 Visual Key Principles for Power BI Dashboards

This guide outlines essential design principles to create effective, accessible, and user-friendly Power BI dashboards, drawing from NHS guidelines and industry best practices.

## 🎯 1. Define Purpose and Audience

- **Clarify Objectives:** Ensure each dashboard has a clear purpose—be it monitoring, analysis, or decision-making.
- **Understand Users:** Tailor designs to the needs and expertise of the target audience, whether clinicians, managers, or analysts.
- **Limit Scope:** Focus on a specific set of metrics to avoid information overload.

## 🧭 2. Prioritise Key Information

- **Highlight KPIs:** Use prominent visuals like card tiles to emphasise critical metrics.
- **Top-Left Placement:** Position the most important information in the top-left corner, following natural reading patterns.
- **Reduce Clutter:** Aim for 6–8 visuals per page to maintain clarity and focus.

## 🎨 3. Consistent Visual Design

- **Uniform Themes:** Apply consistent fonts, colours, and styles across all visuals.
- **Colour Coding:** Use a limited colour palette to represent specific metrics or categories, ensuring consistency throughout the dashboard.
- **Avoid Overuse:** Limit the number of colours to prevent confusion and maintain visual harmony.

## 📐 4. Effective Layout and Alignment

- **Grid System:** Utilise Power BI's gridlines and snapping features to align visuals neatly.
- **Logical Grouping:** Place related visuals together to create a cohesive flow of information.
- **Whitespace:** Incorporate adequate spacing between elements to enhance readability and reduce visual clutter.

## 🧩 5. Interactive Elements

- **Slicers and Filters:** Provide users with tools to customise their view, but avoid overuse to prevent interface clutter.
- **Bookmarks:** Use bookmarks to create predefined views or guided navigation paths.
- **Tooltips:** Add descriptive tooltips to visuals for additional context without overcrowding the interface.

## ♿ 6. Accessibility and Inclusivity

- **Contrast Ratios:** Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background to aid readability.
- **Alternative Text:** Provide descriptive alt text for visuals to support screen readers.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimise dashboards for various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## 🔄 7. Performance Optimisation

- **Data Reduction:** Filter data at the source to minimise the volume loaded into Power BI.
- **Visual Count:** Limit the number of visuals on each page to enhance performance.
- **Efficient Queries:** Use efficient DAX queries and avoid complex calculations that can slow down performance.

## 🔍 8. Testing and Feedback

- **User Testing:** Regularly test dashboards with actual users to identify usability issues.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Use feedback to make continuous improvements to the dashboard design.
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation of design choices and data sources for transparency and future reference.
